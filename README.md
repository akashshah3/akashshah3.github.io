## ✨ Design & Features

### Swiss Minimalist Aesthetic
- **Typography**: Typeset in `Inter` (Body) and `Manrope` (Headings) for maximum readability and modern appeal.
- **Palette**: High-contrast black & white theme (`Stone-50` / `Stone-950`) emphasizing negative space.
- **Layout**: Structured "Bento Box" grid for projects and certifications.

### 🎭 Advanced Animations
We avoided generic fade-ins in favor of physics-based, editorial motions:
- **Editorial Text Reveal**: Hero text "slides up" word-by-word from a masked container, mimicking high-end magazine motion design.
- **Magnetic Micro-Interactions**: Social buttons and interactive elements have a subtle "magnetic pull" that follows the cursor.
- **Physics-Based Scroll Progress**: A minimal progress bar at the top that interprets scroll velocity with spring physics.
- **Custom Bezier Transitions**: All entrances use a custom cubic-bezier curve `[0.21, 0.47, 0.32, 0.98]` for a premium "heavy" feel.

### ⚡ Performance
- **100/100 Lighthouse Score** (Target).
- **Zero Layout Shift**: Fixed height containers and font preloading to prevent CLS.
- **Accessible**: Semantic HTML5 structure and `aria-labels` for all interactive elements.
